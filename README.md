# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

## Description

This is a group project(can be done alone) for the C programming language focused on binary trees. The project aims to reinforce knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and programming in C. It covers topics such as binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, max binary heaps, and various tree traversal methods..
